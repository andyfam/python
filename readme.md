# Random

by import the random module, we can generate random number, select a random element from a collection, or shuffle a collection.

# Exception

exceptions are events that interrupt the normal execution flow, so we need to deal with it by `try` block,  the keyword `else` is used to indicate the code block that will be executed if no exceptions threw.
